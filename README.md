# Hi, I'm Mikkel ðŸ‘‹ðŸª´

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). 
My main areas of interest are
- Algorithms,
- Programming languages,
- Software architecture,
- Graph Theory,
- Compiler design,
- DevOps.


**On this profile, you'll find:**
*   ðŸŽ“ **Academic Explorations:** Code related to my university coursework and larger projects. These demonstrate concepts I've learned and applied. You might find forks here related to group assignments or course materials.
**    > [!IMPORTANT]

*   ðŸ’¡ **Personal Tinkering:** My personal playground! These repositories contain projects I build for fun, to learn something new (currently exploring C# and Raylib!), or to solve a small problem that bugs me.

Feel free to look around!
I'm always learning and enjoy technical discussions, so don't be afraid to message me with anything.
